- 👋 Hi, I’m @MichaelViernes
- 👀 I’m interested in anything free. It catches my eyes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer sciences and just "try everything!" courses online.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game development because I have not developed a game before successfully.
- 📫 I'd like to teach people the beauty of programming.
